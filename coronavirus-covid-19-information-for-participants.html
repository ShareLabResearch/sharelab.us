Information from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic suggests that this virus is spreading more easily than influenza, making it highly contagious. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html"><sup>2</sup></a></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, typically via small droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or can possibly be inhaled into the lungs. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html"><sup>3</sup></a></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being in close proximity to an infected person for a prolonged period of time (usually within 6 feet for 10 minutes) can put you at a higher risk of infection (CDC, 2020). <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html"><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"><sup>4</sup></span></a></span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virus particles can also settle on surfaces such as doorknobs, countertops, and drinking glasses, or be transmitted through contact via shaking hands or hugging. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html"><sup>5</sup></a></span></p><p><b><i><span style="color: #000080;">How is the SHARE Lab protecting participants and lab personnel from COVID-19?</span></i></b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SHARE Lab is committed to the health of our research participants and staff. We’ll be strictly adhering to CDC guidelines and the Southern Methodist University’s guidelines and recommendations <sup><a href="https://www.smu.edu/BusinessFinance/HR/BenefitsAndWellness/Coronavirus/welcome-back">6</a></sup> to ensure that our research activities are safe for everyone involved.</span></p><p><strong>Lab Space:</strong></p><ul><li>Prior to welcoming you to our lab space, we complete a thorough sanitation protocol to disinfect lab equipment and heavily touched surfaces. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/disinfecting-your-home.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"><sup>7</sup></span></span></a></li><li>The lab space is also checked regularly to ensure proper ventilation, reducing the likelihood of spread (<span class="content"><span class="text surname"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412020317876">Morawska et al., 2020</a>).</span></span></li></ul><p><strong>Lab Members:</strong></p><ul><li>Our research team is trained to recognize the signs and symptoms of COVID-19.

(If this were to happen, please be understanding of the short notice cancellation as we want to do our absolute best in ensuring yours and our research team’s safety).</li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff members will also wear a mask that covers the nose and mouth at all times for your protection and their own.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our research team members will maintain 6-foot distance when there is no need for contact</span></li></ul><p><strong>Participants:</strong></p><ul><li>You will undergo two COVID-19 phone screenings before your visit.</li><li>When you arrive for your study visit, a team member will measure your temperature and ask screening questions before escorting you to the lab space.</li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants must wear a mask when research team members are present. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html"><sup>8</sup></a>  Masks are important to wear because COVID-19 can be spread by people who do not know they are sick. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html"><sup>9</sup></a></span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the nature of our study visits, our research team members will have to be in direct contact with you for certain activities, e.g., when taking blood pressure, collecting blood spots, etc. During these activities, our research team members will use a plexiglass barrier to reduce any spread of droplets. </span></li></ul><p><span style="color: #000080;"><b><i>What steps can I take to prevent the spread of COVID-19?</i></b></span></p><p><span style="color: #000000;">Please let us know as soon as possible if you or your partner appear to have acute respiratory illness symptoms (i.e. cough, shortness of breath), sneezing, and/or fever OR if you or your partner has come in contact with someone who has these symptoms within the past 14 days. We must take necessary precautions to protect the health of all participants and lab members, and hence, would need to reschedule your visit if that is the case.</span></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html">Here</a></span> is more information on what to do if you are sick.
