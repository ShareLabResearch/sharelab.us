  <p>
    Here at the SHARE lab, we strive to understand how loved ones shape our well-being and physical health—from the ability to stand and walk with ease, down to the generation of new immune cells. Using observational methods, we track partners’ social dynamics and physiological patterns in the lab and everyday life to understand the ways in which close relationships may serve as a boon or a liability to our health. We also study how relationship dynamics may evolve as we age, and how social-emotional and biological changes across adulthood may amplify or dampen the effects of our social lives on the health of our aging bodies.<br><br>Please explore our website to find out more about who we are, what we are currently working on, and how you can be involved.

<h4><strong>Couples’ Health Across Adulthood Study</strong></h4>
<p>Funded by the National Institutes of Health, this project explores how life with a partner may affect physical health through changes to the immune and cardiovascular systems. We hope to gain knowledge that could inform future interventions to benefit the health of couples.  To qualify for the study participants must:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Have been living together as a couple for at least three years</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Be aged 25 or older</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Be English-speaking</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Not be currently pregnant or breastfeeding</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Two study visits are required, and weekend time slots are available. </span>During both visits, you will answer a variety of questions about your thoughts, feelings, positive and negative personal life experiences with COVID-19 and in general, demographic information, physical health, mental health, medications, diet, physical activity, personality, relationship with your partner, and other social relationships. In addition, to taking surveys you will also be asked to take part in several different conversations with your partner. Throughout each visit, we will be collecting physical and health-related information using a variety of different methods, such as using a heart monitor and completing physical tasks. Participants who complete the study will be compensated for their time. The consent forms below describe more about the study protocols and procedures.</p>

<h4>Participant Testimonials:</h4>
<h5>"When [my partner] and I were invited to participate in this study we thought; "Oh Well, it will just be some kind of discussion around a table" BUT it was so much more.  During the lab time, we found ourselves involved in deep discussions about what our relationship meant to each other.  We came away learning more about our partner and the value of our marriage.</h5>
<h5>It was a relaxed atmosphere and a unique and enjoyable experience."</h5>

                <p><span style="color: #000080;"><b><i>What are the symptoms of COVID-19? </i></b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2020), people with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:</span></p>
<ul>
 	
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fever or chills</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cough</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fatigue</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muscle or body aches</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headache</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New loss of taste or smell</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sore throat</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congestion or runny nose</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nausea or vomiting</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diarrhea</span></li>
</ul>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This list does not include all possible symptoms. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><b><i>How is COVID-19 spread?</i></b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads very easily between people. Information from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic suggests that this virus is spreading more easily than influenza, making it highly contagious. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html"><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, typically via small droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or can possibly be inhaled into the lungs. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html"><sup>3</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being in close proximity to an infected person for a prolonged period of time (usually within 6 feet for 10 minutes) can put you at a higher risk of infection (CDC, 2020). <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html"><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"><sup>4</sup></span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virus particles can also settle on surfaces such as doorknobs, countertops, and drinking glasses, or be transmitted through contact via shaking hands or hugging. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html"><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="color: #000080;">How is the SHARE Lab protecting participants and lab personnel from COVID-19?</span></i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SHARE Lab is committed to the health of our research participants and staff. We’ll be strictly adhering to CDC guidelines and the Southern Methodist University’s guidelines and recommendations <sup><a href="https://www.smu.edu/BusinessFinance/HR/BenefitsAndWellness/Coronavirus/welcome-back">6</a></sup> to ensure that our research activities are safe for everyone involved.</span></p>
<p><strong>Lab Space:</strong></p>
<ul>
 	
<li>Prior to welcoming you to our lab space, we complete a thorough sanitation protocol to disinfect lab equipment and heavily touched surfaces. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/disinfecting-your-home.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"><sup>7</sup></span></span></a></li>
<li>The lab space is also checked regularly to ensure proper ventilation, reducing the likelihood of spread (<span class="content"><span class="text surname"><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412020317876">Morawska et al., 2020</a>).</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Lab Members:</strong></p>
<ul>
 	
<li>Our research team is trained to recognize the signs and symptoms of COVID-19. In accordance with SMU guidelines, before coming to the lab, team members are required to:</li>
<li>Self-screen for any symptoms of respiratory illness – cough, fever, muscle aches, shortness of breath.</li>
<li>Any team member who feels ill will be required to stay at home and your visit will be rescheduled. (If this were to happen, please be understanding of the short notice cancellation as we want to do our absolute best in ensuring yours and our research team’s safety).</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff members will also wear a mask that covers the nose and mouth at all times for your protection and their own.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our research team members will maintain 6-foot distance when there is no need for contact</span></li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Participants:</strong></p>
<ul>
 	
<li>You will undergo two COVID-19 phone screenings before your visit.</li>
<li>When you arrive for your study visit, a team member will measure your temperature and ask screening questions before escorting you to the lab space.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants must wear a mask when research team members are present. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html"><sup>8</sup></a>  Masks are important to wear because COVID-19 can be spread by people who do not know they are sick. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html"><sup>9</sup></a></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the nature of our study visits, our research team members will have to be in direct contact with you for certain activities, e.g., when taking blood pressure, collecting blood spots, etc. During these activities, our research team members will use a plexiglass barrier to reduce any spread of droplets. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>
<span style="color: #000080;"><b><i>What steps can I take to prevent the spread of COVID-19? </i></b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Please let us know as soon as possible if you or your partner appear to have acute respiratory illness symptoms (i.e. cough, shortness of breath), sneezing, and/or fever OR if you or your partner has come in contact with someone who has these symptoms within the past 14 days. We must take necessary precautions to protect the health of all participants and lab members, and hence, would need to reschedule your visit if that is the case. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html">Here</a></span> is more information on what to do if you are sick. Find out when you can <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/end-home-isolation.html">safely be around others after being sick with COVID-19</a>.</span></p>
<p>You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick. For this reason, we require all research team members and participants to wear a mask. Here is additional information on how to wear cloth face coverings. In case you do not have a mask, our lab will provide you one.</p>
<p>Remember that the face mask is not a substitute for social distancing. <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html"><sup>10</sup></a></span> Please keep maximum distance between yourself and others when you come into our lab space.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><b><i>What if I and/or my partner come up with symptoms after scheduling a visit?</i></b><b>      </b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #000000;">If you have a fever, cough, or other symptoms (listed above), you might have COVID-19. If you think you may have been exposed to COVID-19, contact your healthcare provider. </span></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">More information for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html">people who have had close contact</a></span> with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 is available on the CDC website. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #000000;"> If you have symptoms or you have been in contact with someone who has symptoms, please notify us as soon as possible by calling our lab phone at <strong>(214) 768-2399</strong> or by email at <strong>sharelab@smu.edu</strong>. Thank you for working with us to keep everyone healthy!</span>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: #000000;">Again, remember that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms. In either case, please notify us as soon as possible by calling our lab phone at <strong>(214) 768-2399</strong>. We will work with you to find a better time for you to come in!</span><b></b></span></p>
